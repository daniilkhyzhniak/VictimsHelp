					<div class="violence">
						When we hear about domestic violence, the first thing we do is imagine a tyrant husband and a victim wife who is forced to endure beatings and abuse. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of cases of domestic violence are violence of a man against a woman. Nevertheless, the opposite cases - female violence against a man - are much more common than it seems.

						The reasons why men are silent
    Firstly, this topic is so taboo that a male victim of violence simply does not dare to talk about it, even if he has been physically harmed. After all, a man, by definition, is considered the stronger sex, and to admit violence against himself, and even on the part of the weaker sex, means a fiasco for him. If victim blaming - the blame of the victim - flourishes violently in society towards women, one can imagine what awaits a man who finds himself in a situation of violence from a woman.
    <br>
    Secondly, women's violence is more often not in the physical, but in the moral sphere. A woman abuser is not necessarily a shaggy woman with a rolling pin. She can look great, take care of herself and have impeccable manners and taste. She acts covertly, through manipulation, humiliating and blackmailing, skillfully using any available leverage. Such behavior has a destructive effect on the psyche, but at the same time the male victim will be instilled with such a sense of guilt that he will blame himself and only himself for everything.

						What if your wife is an abuser?
    It is important to understand that psychological abuse does real damage to your psyche. You have to accept what will not be better. The character of an adult cannot be changed, and if the person is prone to manipulation and openly uses it, your many concessions will not be beneficial. Remember that family comfort and warmth are just as important in life as career and other achievements. Try to deal with your past, if at the moment you tolerate such an attitude towards yourself, then this may be the result of similar behavior of other women close to you. Perhaps your mother treated you in a similar way, she could publicly shame or beat you.
