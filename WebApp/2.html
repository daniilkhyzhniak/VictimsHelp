						The United Nations defines violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that causes or is likely to cause physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats to commit such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether in public or private.

Psychological (emotional) violence is threats, rudeness, bullying, verbal abuse and any other behavior that causes negative emotional reactions and mental pain. Emotional abuse is much more difficult to identify. Although they do not leave bruises on the body, they can be much more destructive and, together with other kinds of influences, including physical ones, more traumatize the psyche.

Thus, violence is a form of manifestation of mental and / or physical coercion in relation to one of the interacting parties, which forces this party to do something against its will, desires, needs. In this case, a party can mean an individual or a group of people.
